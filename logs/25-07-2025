 Day 1 of My Cybersecurity Journey — Lab Setup + First Nmap Scans

 Date: July 25, 2025
 Phase 0: Lab Setup (From Zero to Purple Team)
 Who Am I?

 Hi! I’m starting a public journey from absolute beginner to Purple Team cybersecurity professional by mid-2026.
 I’ll be learning everything — from hacking tools to forensics, red teaming to SIEM detection — and sharing it all here,    one step at a time.
 What I Did Today — Phase 0 Begins
 Step 1: Built My Lab Environment

 I installed three virtual machines inside VirtualBox:
 VM	Role
 Kali Linux	Main attacker machine
 Metasploitable 2	Vulnerable target machine
 Windows 10	Defensive/real-world system

 I configured Bridged Adapter networking so all the machines are on the same subnet (e.g. 192.168.1.X) — this is important      so they can “see” each other inside the virtual lab.
 ✅ Step 2: Scanned My Systems with Nmap

 I used Nmap from Kali to scan the Windows and Metasploitable VMs.
  Scan Results – Windows 10

 Only a few ports were open:

    5040 – Unknown
    5357 – wsdapi (Windows Device API)
    7680 – pando-pub (Delivery Optimization)
 These are default Windows services, not vulnerabilities — so the system is pretty secure.
 
 Scan Results – Metasploitable 2
 many ports were open — including:
    FTP
    Telnet
    Apache (HTTP)
    Samba (SMB)
    MySQL
This VM is made to be vulnerable, so it’s perfect for practicing exploitation and enumeration in future phases.

Step 3: Practiced Nmap Commands
I tested these commands to explore deeper:
nmap -p- 192.168.1.X
nmap --script vuln 192.168.1.X
nmap -sV -O -Pn 192.168.1.X -oN win_scan.txt

Quick Explanation:
    -p- — scans all 65,535 TCP ports
    --script vuln — checks for known vulnerabilities
    -sV — detects service versions
    -O — OS detection
    -Pn — skips ping, helpful for stealth

 Accounts I Set Up
To start participating in labs and practice platforms, I created:
     TryHackMe
     Hack The Box
     GitHub – where I’ll upload my scripts, scans, and tools

 What I Learned Today
    How to set up a functioning cyber lab with attacker and victim VMs
    What a typical scan looks like on secure vs vulnerable machines
    That port scanning and service enumeration is the first step of every cyber attack chain
